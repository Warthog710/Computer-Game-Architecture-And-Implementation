Tested and working on ECS-Quake in the RVR 5029 Lab

Note: If you get the following error "Error: A JNI error has occurred, please check your installation and try again" delete the
.class files in both the a1 and myGameEngine folder. Use the the provided compile.bat to recompile the project and try running the
program again. This error occures due to compilation on a different Java Version.
